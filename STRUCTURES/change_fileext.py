# Given a list of filenames, we want to rename all the files with extension hpp to the extension h. To do this, we would like to generate a new list called newfilenames, consisting of the new filenames. Fill in the blanks in the code using any of the methods youâ€™ve learned thus far, like a for loop or a list comprehension.

filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]
# Generate newfilenames as a list containing the new filenames
# using as many lines of code as your chosen method requires.

    return [filename.replace(old, new) if filename.endswith(old) else filename for filename in filenames]

newfilenames = change_ext(filenames, "hpp", "h")

# Should be ["program.c", "stdio.h", "sample.h", "a.out", "math.h", "hpp.out"]
